# Depression Prediction
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
According to WHO ( World Health Organisation ), there are 8 billion people in the World out of which 130 million people visit the ER (Emergency Room) every year for any illness, sickness and other issues. It takes a Physician, a family doctor, a specialist and a chief doctor to diagnose a disease and make a critical decision about the treatment process.
Therefore, it takes an average of at least a day or two to diagnose a deadly disease within which the disease could have spread further and made even more damage.
Automating reading DTI MRI, MRI, CT scans and EMG scans of mood- affected and non-affected individuals
Quantify the dominant fiber orientation
Read Structural & Neural connections of the organs
High-accuracy Computer Aided Diagnosis 

## PROPOSED SOLUTION:
The aim of the research is to automate and compute the detection of possible vulnerability to any disease before it’s onset. 
It is important for a Doctor to spend enough time on a patient’s diagnosis as it decides the course of treatment.
But reading the scans manually could lead to errors in diagnosis and exhaust the working time of a doctor too.
This situation can be avoided using a model that was created by Machine Learning and Data Analysis.
Algorithms like SVM,CNN,LSTM etc can be used accordingly. This model can comprehend, analyze and automatically produce the health report of a patient in seconds thus saving time and lives at the same time.
A questionnaire with symptom based question is trained with ML to diagnose diseases using the symptom by asking the patients directly.
